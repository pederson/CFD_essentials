TODO:


- Make Simulation class that handles the setup and execution of a simulation
	- Need to finish the equation class and boundary conditions class to do this

- Increase encapsulation with getters and setters
- support for cylindrical and polar coordinates (maybe not necessary)

- Interface for libMesh, Eigen, Boost, CGAL, and any other third party libraries that are useful


- make separate object files that can be used elsewhere, like Point. Or use CGAL.

- Something is wrong with the Hull->contains_point() code... is this a double to float conversion issue?

- color by boundary doesn't work properly (b/c bool conversion to float maybe?)

- Check out the Fluent .cas, .msh and .neu files to see how they are stored. Maybe also be able to read these in and print them out. Also check out Ansys .cmdb and .dsdb format.
- Check out AutoCAD .dxf file format for parametric models. Also look at .obj and .ply formats. Look at .step and .iges files for 3D models

- fix the issue with the gaussian geometric object overwriting all other properties on the mesh

- create an actual converter class (or decide if it is really worth it)

- Derive the RegularMesh from Static_Mesh instead of having a bunch of functions related to regular meshes

- use max_element and min_element as a means to get the min/max

	***Visualixer todo:
- add a labelled colorbar to the visualixer
- Panning scale needs refinement
- Gimbal lock is still happening during manual rotation
- adding a colorby before adding an object (mesh, pointcloud) doesn't work b/c it gets overwritten
- Shading and Light source for mesh model viewer


- Doxygen comments for everything
- Equation setter
- Chemistry setter and data (lxcat?)
- Boundary conditions/ Initial Conditions
- Source setter
- Matrix equation assembler (parallelizable)
- Matrix equation solver (parallelizable)
