TODO:

- Shading and Light source for mesh model viewer
- Create getters and setters for everything
- support for cylindrical and polar coordinates
- Class for saving simulation output
- Create separate Static Mesh and Mutable Mesh classes
- Convert everything that uses char* to use std::string instead
- add a ::print_detailed() function to classes for detailed debugging
- figure out a good way to store base data, optional data, and user-defined data in classes
	- idea: store it all in raw pointer arrays
	- access the raw data by a ::.data(std::string field) call
- make constructors that work with raw data pointers

- follow these rules: https://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/lab/cplus/c++.rules/chap7.html
	- inline member functions
	- copy constructor
	- const member functions
	- virtual destructor for base classes
	- assignment operator
	- always const reference to member data from public member functions

- Interface for libMesh, Eigen, Boost, CGAL, and any other third party libraries that are useful

- Doxygen comments for everything
X - Mesh Class
X - Visualizer
- Equation setter
X - Property setter
X - Geometry builder
- Boundary conditions/ Initial Conditions
- Matrix equation assembler (parallelizable)
- Matrix equation solver (parallelizable)
