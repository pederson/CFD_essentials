TODO:

- incorporate cvector for use in other parts of the code (storing to simdata for example)

- Should simdata be stored on heap instead of stack? Can be large sometimes

- create an actual converter class (or decide if it is really worth it)

- use max_element and min_element as a means to get the min/max

- Allow the SimulationData class to store data even if the full data has not been allocated. Figure out how to add time data to a file that already exists

- fix the issue with the gaussian geometric object overwriting all other properties on the mesh

- Make a standard Finite difference derivative operator class or function that accepts a regular mesh and a field variable, then takes the requested derivative (and uses the requested technique for dealing with the boundary)

- Make a way to combine simulation data into one file if the mesh in each file matches

- Make a way to get the "previous" value for time stepping simulations

- migrate some things to BitBucket or GitLab

- Do time analysis on cvector. Does it significantly affect performance? TIME ANALYSIS DONE.. it does affect performance a lot... maybe I can scale the scope of it back to do only 1 or 2 vectors, 1 multiplicative constant, and 1 additive constant. 

- lxcat for cross section and coefficient data

- Start using (and learn how to use) a time profiler. lcov/gcov? gprof? Valgrind? Or https://code.google.com/p/high-performance-cplusplus-profiler/ 

- Frequency analysis tools (DFT) for the FDTD sim. Other signal processing tools are good too. 

- Chiggidy Check Yoself Before You Wreck Yoself for the visualizers and anything else that could easily crash

- Figure out how to output the OpenGL window to .png, .tif, .jpg OR make movies to .gif

- Problem writing holey_waveguide_defect geometry simulation to HDF5... only on school computer though... and only happens sometimes...

- Geometric Objects need to have an options to do a repeating pattern (either rectangular or circular)

- Explore using Boost library (what can it do for me?)

- Make Simulation class that handles the setup and execution of a simulation
	- Need to finish the equation class and boundary conditions class to do this
	- Make this a base class maybe. Derived classes of FESimulation, FVSimulation, FDSimulation, FDTDSimulation, etc... can be made
	- This should allow the user to run the simulation incrementally (n steps at a time) and access fields in the middle of the simulation
	- Is it possibly better to NOT have a base simulation class?

- start using iterators when possible

- Fix Mesh class and SimulationData class to have storage fields for both NodeData and ElementData (where data is associated per node or element, respectively)

- Make a read_HDF5() method for SimulationData. Then make a script to quickly view simulation files or write to gif, jpg, etc.

- fix all class accessors to have both const and non-const options... this is important

- support boundary properties (with conditions that v=0, etc...)

- support initial conditions in a general manner

- Increase encapsulation with getters and setters

- support for cylindrical and polar coordinates (maybe not necessary)

- Interface for libMesh, Eigen, Boost, CGAL, and any other third party libraries that are useful

- make separate object files that can be used elsewhere, like Point3 and Vector3. Or use CGAL.

- Something is wrong with the Hull->contains_point() code... is this a double to float conversion issue?

- color by boundary doesn't work properly (b/c bool conversion to float maybe?)

- Check out the Fluent .cas, .msh and .neu files to see how they are stored. Maybe also be able to read these in and print them out. Also check out Ansys .cmdb and .dsdb format.

- Check out AutoCAD .dxf file format for parametric models. Also look at .obj and .ply formats. Look at .step and .iges files for 3D models

- Make sure that everything follows the model of having all necessary information contained in the base class, but with added functionality implemented in the derived classes. If this isn't satisfied, maybe they should be separate classes.

	***Visualixer todo:
- add a labelled colorbar to the visualixer
- Panning scale needs refinement
- Gimbal lock is still happening during manual rotation
- adding a colorby or alpha before adding an object (mesh, pointcloud) doesn't work b/c the number of points is still unknown... is there a workaround for this?
- Shading and Light source for mesh model viewer
- Make a convention where there are expected to be Point, Line, Triangle, and Quad elements. The number of them are set by the user, but they are always in that order. Also, normals should be standard.
- for simulation viz, instead of setting frequency, have a target framerate and set the simulation snapshot increment number
- for sim viz, have option to show vector arrows if it's a flow



- Doxygen comments for everything
- Equation setter
- Chemistry setter and data (lxcat?)
